# About Me
I am studying for a Ph.D. in Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence at Renmin University of China, where I am advised by [Xu Chen](http://xu-chen.com/).

# Research Interests
- Recommendation System
    - Sequential Recommendation System
    - General Recommendation System
- Causal Inference
    - Robust Causal Inference
    - Reliable Causal Inference
My main research interests is to build robust and reliable causal models, as well as their applications in recommendation systems. Specifically, I mainly focus on the covariate adjustment algorithms, robust causal effect algorithms, and algorithms for generating unobservable confounders under representation learning. In the context of recommendation systems, I focus on using causal inference mechanisms to build unbiased, robust, and causal interpretable recommendation models. I also focus on causal discovery, causal structure learning, and causal deep learning, and I hope to make some attempts and explorations in these areas.
